// manifest_files:
//   Manfiest tsv file paths containing a row per sample and any genomic files
//   associated with that sample. Each row must contain at least
//   'participant_id' and 'sample_id' columns. Any additional columns will be
//   indexed as sample metadata. Columns containing known file types (BAM, CRAM,
//   FASTQ, VCF) will be speicially interpreted and the sample will have a
//   'has_<FILE_TYPE>' field set.
//
//   Currently GCS file paths (gs://) and local file paths (relative to this
//   directory) are supported.
